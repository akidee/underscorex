Underscorex are some basic extensions for underscore.js

  - extends JavaScript natives to implement missing ECMA5 functionality
  - provides basic functionality
  - runs in all environments, server and client
  - small footprint




Features

1. Some ECMA5 functionality must be available in all JavaScript engines:

  Object.keys
  Date.prototype.toISOString
  JSON.parse/stringify
  Function.prototype.bind
  String.prototype.trim
  Array.prototype.indexOf/lastIndexOf
  Array.prototype.every/some/forEach/map/filter
  Array.prototype.reduce/reduceRight

  See http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/

2. Functionality beyond ECMA5 - functions that are already included in underscore.js: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore

3. My own mixins:

  _.log(...)
    Alias of console.log. Can be called even if the console object is not defined

  _.isRecursable(object)
    Returns true if object is recursable - in opposite to instances of Date, Function or simple types

  _.extend(object, source, ...)
    Overwrites underscore's _.extend to iterate over own properties only

  _.extendDeep(object, source, ..., preserve = false)
    Extends object with other objects by deep tree recursion. Does not consider circular references. To preserve existing properties of object, pass true as the last argument

  _.objectToArray(object)
    Transforms an object to a list of lists with 2 elements each (key and value). Example:

    _.objectToArray({ a: 1, b: true }) --> [ [ a, 1 ], [ b, true ] ]

    Applying Array.prototype functionality to objects is very useful, but underscore's collection utilities return an array of the values of the passed objects and omit the keys. But we don't want to miss the keys and filter, sort, ... by them as well.

    For example, you can sort an object by keys by sorting the result of _.objectToArray(object) and then transform it back to an object with _.arrayToObject. The ECMA standard does _not_ force implementors to iterate over objects in the same order as the properties were defined, but all JS engines will do that for non-numeric properties. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/280713/elements-order-in-a-for-in-loop/280861#280861

  _.arrayToObject(array)
    Transforms a list of lists - with key and value each - back to an object. Example:

    _.arrayToObject([ [ a, 1 ], [ 5, true ] ]) --> { 'a': 1, '5': true }

  _.escapeXml(string, newline = false)

  _.simple(string, preserveCase = false)
    Get a simplified version of a string by trimming, reducing whitespace and setting it to lower case, which can be prohibited by passing true as the second argument

  _.escapeForRegExp(string)
    Escape characters to make a string non-semantic when using it in a regular expression

  _.locale(object, locale?)
    Examples:

    var data = { de_DE: 'Zentrum', en_UK: 'centre', en: 'center' }
    _.locale(data, 'de') --> 'Zentrum'
    _.locale(data) --> 'center'

  _.MAX_INT
    Maximum integer in JavaScript: 9007199254740992
    See http://www.irt.org/script/1031.htm

  _.MIN_INT
    0 - _.MAX_INT




Use it in node

var _ = require('underscorex')

	


Use it in the browser (with Yabble)

The best way to use CommonJS modules with their dependencies on the client is wrapping them and loading them asynchronously with Yabble. Put /client/yabble/underscore.js to the correct path on your server, and that's it. The file already includes underscore.js v1.2.3

1) To simply use underscorex:

<script src="https://raw.github.com/akidee/yabble/master/lib/yabble.js"></script>
<script src="/js/underscorex.js"></script>
<script>

	_.log('ready')

</script>

2) Pro mode: Load your project asynchronously, in this case only underscorex:

<script src="https://raw.github.com/akidee/yabble/master/lib/yabble.js"></script>
<script>

	require.useScriptTags()
	require.setModuleRoot('/js')
	require.ensure([ 'underscorex' ], function (require) {

		_.log('ready')
	})

</script>

It is recommended to serve static files with gzip!
